# Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Projects

## Thomas Woodside

The [Udacity Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nd013) is a fantastic program that teaches 
beginners in the field the fundamentals of the cutting-edge field of self-driving cars. The first term covers everything 
from convolutional neural networks, one of the latest developments in self-driving car technology, to traditional 
computer vision techniques. The second term covers sensor fusion, localization, and control.

One of Udacity's biggest strengths is its project-based learning system. At the end of every unit, students must 
complete projects to implement the new skills they have learned. In this repository, I have posted all of the projects
that I did during the program- coming in with just a basic knowledge of python and stats, what Udacity taught me is 
quite impressive!

I'm excited to continue with my work in the Nanodegree, and will continue to update this repository as I finish more 
projects.

Full Disclosure- After completing the Data Analyst Nanodegree, I began working as an independently contracted Forum Mentor for the 
Data Analyst Nanodegree.
